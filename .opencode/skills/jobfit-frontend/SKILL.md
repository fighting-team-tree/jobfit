description: Implement JobFit React/Vite UI with Tailwind and Zustand, keeping types explicit and lint clean.
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  stack: react-vite
  workspace: jobfit

## What I do
- Build or update pages in `client/src/pages` using Tailwind
- Use Zustand store patterns in `client/src/lib/store.ts`
- Keep TypeScript types explicit; avoid `any`
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` after changes, especially refactor/bugfix work
- For refactors/bugfixes, prefer the smallest safe diff
- Prioritize the antigravity IDE workflow for main implementation work

## When to use me
Use this skill for UI updates, state changes, or any TypeScript fixes in the frontend.
