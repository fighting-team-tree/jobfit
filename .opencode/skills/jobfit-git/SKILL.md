## What I do
- Follow the commit message structure: `type: Subject` with optional body
- Use types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Keep subject imperative and without a trailing period
- Prefer atomic commits (one feature/fix per commit)
- Follow branch naming: feature/*, fix/*, hotfix/*
- Use simplified Gitflow: main (prod), dev (integration), feature/* branches

## When to use me
Use this skill for any git commit, branch creation, or PR workflow in JobFit.
