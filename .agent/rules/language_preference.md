# Language Preference Rules

## 1. Primary Language: Korean (한국어)
- All communication, including explanations, questions, and status updates, MUST be in **Korean**.
- **Artifacts** specifically mentioned below MUST be written in Korean:
  - **Implementation Plans** (구현 계획)
  - **Task Lists / Todo** (작업 목록)
  - **Walkthroughs** (워크스루 / 작업 상세 설명)

## 2. Technical Terms
- Standard technical terms, library names, and variable names should be kept in **English** or standard technical notation to maintain clarity (e.g., `WebSocket`, `React`, `FastAPI`, `BackgroundTasks`).
- If a term has a widely accepted Korean translation, it can be used, but English terms are preferred for code-related contexts.

## 3. Code Comments
- Inline code comments can be in English or Korean, but consistent Korean explanations are preferred for block comments describing complex logic.
