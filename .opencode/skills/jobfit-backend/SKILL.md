description: Implement and update JobFit FastAPI endpoints and services with uv, Pydantic models, and async patterns.

## What I do
- Add or modify FastAPI endpoints under `server/app/api/v1/endpoints`
- Keep request/response models in sync with frontend contracts
- Use `uv` for Python dependency management and commands
- Follow async/await patterns and type hints
- For refactors/bugfixes, keep changes minimal and safe
- After backend refactor/bugfix changes, run relevant checks via `uv` when available
- Prioritize the antigravity IDE workflow for main implementation work

## When to use me
Use this skill when adding or changing backend API behavior, Pydantic models, or service logic for JobFit.
Ask for clarification if an API contract change affects existing frontend flows.
